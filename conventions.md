## NAMING CONVENTIONS

---

### Regarding object struct :

* _def   - after name means default
* _s     - for shadows
* _i     - for instancing    *(WARNING : Can be combined, for example _si )*
* _plmt  - for placement
* _dpth - for depth
* _a - for animations

This is used both in naming methods and shaders.
